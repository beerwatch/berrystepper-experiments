# berrystepper-experiments
Unsorted examples of controlling stepper motor on Raspberry PI (waited, timered exe, kmod + mque, sysfs). Mixed timer + interrupt todrive the stepper pulse output up to 20kHz.

I prepared and used these examples in a curse I called Linux Deep Horizons. After completing the course, the graduates started to call me "Father Linux."
